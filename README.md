# ClassConnect

ClassConnect is a simple messaging platform for students to communicate with their teachers. Students can anonymously ask questions in a class chat-room and quickly get their questions answered by the instructor or other students.

Students: Quickly enter the chat-room by entering the room ID provided by your teacher, no account needed. All messages are anonymous.

Teachers: Create an account to form a chat-room for your students. You will be provided a room ID upon creation of your account.
