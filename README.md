# ClassConnect

ClassConnect is a simple messaging platform on iOS for students to communicate with their teachers. Students can anonymously ask questions in a class chat-room and quickly get their questions answered by the instructor or other students.

### Students
Quickly enter the chat-room by entering the room ID provided by your teacher, no account needed. All messages are anonymous.

### Teachers
Create an account to form a chat-room for your students. You will be provided a room ID upon creation of your account.

This project was written in Swift 3 with Xcode 8.
